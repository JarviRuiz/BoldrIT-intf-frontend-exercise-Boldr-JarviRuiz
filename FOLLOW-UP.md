### Follow Up Questions:

1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?

R= I didnt use any library. I wanted to use my skills with pure html and css, although it would have been easier for me to use a library like bootstrap or material for styles and pagination.

2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

R= I would improve the user experience with a better desing, adding responsive design, improving my pagination system and adding a sorting system, maybe adding some loading animations.  Include some testing.

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
R= I really liked the filter system and the detailed information displayment. Although i think it could have a better design. 

4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
R= I spent most time in the manipulation of the response from the API, because there was a lot of information that i didn't need and it also came in some complicated format with some elements with nested arrays, so i had to create interfaces and format the information with rxjs operators for a better manipulation of the response.
